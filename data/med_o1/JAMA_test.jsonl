Because of the TST result, the patient has a chest radiograph performed, which was unremarkable. Treatment for latent TB infection (LTBI) was recommended based on the positive TST, negative chest radiograph, and recent US arrival from a high-TB–incidence country. The patient asks whether the positive TST result could be due to her BCG vaccination and wants further testing before beginning therapy. Blood is drawn for an interferon-γ release assay (IGRA; see Figure for results).aExplanation of values: nil (the interferon-γ concentration in plasma from blood incubated without antigen [negative control]); TB antigen minus nil (the interferon-γ concentration in plasma from blood stimulated with 3 relatively specific TB peptides) minus nil; and mitogen minus nil (the interferon-γ concentration in plasma from blood stimulated with mitogen minus nil). The mitogen tube contains a mitogen (phytohaemogglutin-P) that is a nonspecific stimulator of T-cells. It is used as a positive control to ensure the capacity to respond to antigens and also serves as a control for correct blood handling and incubation.bFor this IGRA, 1 mL of blood is drawn into each of 3 tubes (nil [negative control], mitogen [positive control], and TB antigens tube). The TB response (TB antigen minus nil) is calculated as the difference in interferon-γ concentration in plasma from blood stimulated with TB antigens minus the interferon-γ concentration in plasma from blood incubated without antigen (nil). A positive IGRA test result occurs when all of the following criteria are met: (1) the nil value is less than 8 IU/mL; (2) the TB antigen minus nil response is greater than or equal to both 0.35 IU/mL and 25% of the nil value; and (3) there is a positive mitogen response.

On examination, his visual acuity was 20/30 OD and 20/25 OS and he had  mutton fat keratic precipitates and 1+ cells in both eyes. The vitreous and retina revealed no signs of inflammation. The day before, he had undergone a positron emission tomography scan to look for evidence of metastatic lung cancer. The result revealed mild to moderate diffuse lymphadenopathy in the neck, axillae, mediastinal, and inguinal regions. The symmetric pattern favored a diagnosis of sarcoidosis; metastatic disease was less likely. Because the scan was consistent with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis in this patient with granulomatous anterior iritis, no further laboratory testing was pursued. The patient started treatment with prednisolone acetate, 1%, 4 times daily in both eyes. A lymph-node biopsy showed lymphoid follicular hyperplasia and nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation, consistent with sarcoidosis. There was no evidence of lymphoma.

The top differential diagnoses at this juncture included contrast-induced nephropathy or immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)–induced acute interstitial nephritis, and empirical high dose steroids were prescribed.Despite observation and steroid treatment, his sCr levels continued to increase over the next 5 days, peaking at 5.8 mg/dL, and the patient progressed into anuric kidney failure, requiring hemodialysis. This prompted a kidney biopsy for definitive diagnosis (Figure). One week later, he received encorafenib, a BRAF inhibitor.1 Two weeks later, the patient’s kidney function began to improve, and hemodialysis was discontinued.

His medical history was significant for several episodes of upper respiratory infection during the previous winter season, and he previously had an adenotonsillectomy several years prior and bilateral ear tubes placed 1 year before presentation. Physical examination showed a mildly tender, nonmobile, left parotid mass near the angle of the mandible with no overlying skin changes or drainage around the mass. There was no lymphadenopathy or other lesions noted in the neck area, and cranial nerve VII was fully intact. Ultrasonography results of the neck showed a left 1.5-cm preauricular nodular mass with internal and marginal vascularity. A neck magnetic resonance imaging study without contrast performed at an outside institution revealed the 1.5-cm heterogeneous intraparotid nodule that was predominantly isotense to glandular tissue on T1 images with vague hypointensity of a small irregular central region, as well as vague hyperintensity on T2 images. He subsequently underwent fine needle aspiration biopsy to assess the lesion, which demonstrated benign-appearing salivary gland tissue and clusters of myoepithelial cells. The mass was continuing to enlarge, and the patient’s pain was increasing in that area, so the decision was made to perform left superficial parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve. Intraoperatively, the left parotid mass was noted to be just below the lower branches of the facial nerve. The excised parotid mass was sent to the pathology department for analysis.

Her mental state had deteriorated progressively over the previous 12 months, following the death of her father. After a period living alone, she had returned to the family home 4 months prior to her presentation and had been noted to be socially withdrawn, preoccupied, and distractible. Her family physician, suspecting a depressive episode, had prescribed citalopram up to a dosage of 40 mg once daily, to no effect. Her family subsequently sought advice from the family physician when the patient was noted to be speaking to herself, expressing concerns about people meaning her harm, and professing the belief that she could hear other peoples’ thoughts.The patient had been born in Sierra Leone after a complicated delivery and had traveled to the United Kingdom as a child with her family, who were fleeing from a civil war. On arrival in the United Kingdom, her family claimed asylum and moved into a small apartment in a high-rise building in central London. Although there was no reported developmental delay, she had struggled academically at school and was bullied for having overweight. She left school without qualifications at age 16 years and worked as a shop assistant. She left this job about a year prior to her referral to psychiatry after a period of sick leave following the death of her father. She was a nonsmoker, did not drink alcohol, and denied illicit drug use. A paternal relative was reported to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia. There was no comorbid physical illness.On review, the patient was kempt and had overweight. Eye contact was fleeting, and she presented as anxious, with a degree of psychomotor agitation. Her speech was normal in rate, volume, and tone, although tangential. There was no other evidence of thought disorder. She denied feeling low in mood or suicidal and was objectively euthymic. There was some sleep disturbance, with the patient reporting being fearful to go to sleep owing to persecutory beliefs regarding her neighbors. She reflected that over the preceding few months, she had experienced a sensation of detachment from her immediate environment, as though it was not real, making her world similar to that of a video game. She reported that in the apartment where she had previously been living, she had realized that something was amiss and had become convinced that the door number of her neighbor’s flat, number 6, signified that they meant her harm. She explained this was because 6 was associated with the number of the devil. She reported hearing her neighbors commenting negatively about her appearance. These distressing experiences prompted her to return to her family home, but she continued to hear her neighbors’ voices making derogatory comments about her appearance and began to hear them commenting on her actions and thoughts in the third person as well. On returning home, her paranoia regarding her previous neighbors worsened, resulting in her rarely leaving the house. The volume and frequency of derogatory auditory hallucinations also worsened, and she reported hearing the thoughts of others as well. There was a degree of insight, and although the patient was convinced of the reality of her experiences, she also saw the stress of losing her father as associated with her experiences and was accepting of input from mental health services.Consider the risk of adverse events and which drugs are approved for use What Would You Do Next?\nA.

Physical examination findings were consistent with left lower-motor-neuron type of facial nerve palsy. She was conscious and well oriented, with no other relevant clinical signs or focal neurological deficits. There was no history of prior COVID-19 infection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was requested, with clinical suspicion of metastasis in view of mildly elevated CA125 levels.The results of MRI of the brain did not reveal any neuroparenchymal or meningeal lesions. However, both maxillary sinuses showed mucosal thickening, which was intermediate to hypointense on T2-weighted imaging and hypointense on T1-weighted imaging with postcontrast enhancement.

The differential based on the biopsy included traumatic ulcerative granuloma with stromal eosinophilia and ulceration due to drug- or infection-related sources. In addition, the possibility of an unsampled submucosal mass with overlying ulceration was suggested by the pathologist who interpreted the biopsy findings. Given our clinical concern for an unsampled neoplasm, the patient subsequently underwent resection of the mass; histologic sections of the specimen are demonstrated in Figure, B.
