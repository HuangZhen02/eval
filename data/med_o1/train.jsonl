In a double-blind study, we enrolled 1,663 patients who had severe heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of no more than 35 percent, and were being treated with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, a loop diuretic, and in most cases digoxin. A total of 822 patients were randomly assigned to receive 25 mg of spironolactone daily and 841 to receive placebo. The primary endpoint was death from all causes.\nResults:\nThe trial was discontinued early, after a mean follow-up period of 24 months, because an interim analysis determined that spironolactone was efficacious. There were 386 deaths in the placebo group (46%) and 284 in the spironolactone group (35%; relative risk of death, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.82; p<0.001). This 30 percent reduction in the risk of death among patients in the spironolactone group was attributed to a lower risk of both death from progressive heart failure and sudden death from cardiac causes. The frequency of hospitalization for worsening heart failure was 35% lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (relative risk of hospitalization, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.77; p<0.001). In addition, patients who received spironolactone had a significant improvement in the symptoms of heart failure, as assessed on the basis of the New York Heart Association functional class (p<0.001).

In a double-blind study, we enrolled 1,663 patients who had NYHA class III or IV heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of no more than 35%, and who were being treated with an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, a loop diuretic, and in most cases digoxin. A total of 822 patients were randomly assigned to receive 25 mg of spironolactone daily and 841 to receive placebo. The primary endpoint was death from all causes.\nResults:\nThe trial was discontinued early, after a mean follow-up period of 24 months, because an interim analysis determined that spironolactone was efficacious. There were 386 deaths in the placebo group (46%) and 284 in the spironolactone group (35%; relative risk of death, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.60 to 0.82; P<0.001). This 30% reduction in the risk of death among patients in the spironolactone group was attributed to a lower risk of both death from progressive heart failure and sudden death from cardiac causes. The frequency of hospitalization for worsening heart failure was 35% lower in the spironolactone group than in the placebo group (relative risk of hospitalization, 0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.54 to 0.77; P<0.001). In addition, patients who received spironolactone had a significant improvement in the symptoms of heart failure, as assessed on the basis of the New York Heart Association functional class (P<0.001). Gynecomastia or breast pain was reported in 10% of men who were treated with spironolactone, as compared with 1 percent of men in the placebo group (P<0.001).

Patients were required to have chronic heart failure (NYHA II-IV), previous admission for a cardiovascular reason, an ejection fraction of less than 0.35, and have been treated optimally with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors unless not tolerated. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or all-cause admission.

{"id": "MedQA_5558", "problem": "Background: Beta-blockers reduce mortality in patients who have chronic heart failure, systolic dysfunction, and are on background treatment with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We aimed to compare the effects of carvedilol and metoprolol on clinical outcome.\nMethods: In a multicenter, double-blind, randomized parallel group trial, we assigned 1511 patients with chronic heart failure to treatment with carvedilol (target dose, 25 mg twice daily) and 1518 to metoprolol (target dose, 50 mg twice daily). The patients were required to have chronic heart failure (NYHA II-IV), the previous admission for a cardiovascular indication, an ejection fraction of < 0.35, and to have been treated optimally with diuretics and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors unless not tolerated. The primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and the composite endpoint of all-cause mortality or all-cause admission. The analysis was done by intention-to-treat.\nFindings: The mean study duration was 58 months (SD, 6). The mean ejection fraction was 0.26 (SD, 0.07) and the mean age was 62 years (SD, 11). The all-cause mortality was 34% (512 of 1511) for carvedilol and 40% (600 of 1518) for metoprolol (hazard ratio, 0.83 [95% CI 0.74-0.93], p = 0.0017). The reduction in all-cause mortality was consistent across pre-defined subgroups. The incidence of side effects and drug withdrawals did not differ significantly between the 2 study groups.\nBased on the best interpretation of the results of this clinical trial, which of the following statements is most accurate?\nA. There is no appreciable, statistically significant difference in overall mortality between the 2 treatment arms.\nB. Carvedilol demonstrated a significant improvement in all-cause mortality in patients with heart failure as compared to metoprolol.\nC.

We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effect of eplerenone, a selective aldosterone blocker, on morbidity and mortality among patients with acute myocardial infarction complicated by left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure.\nMethods: Patients were randomly assigned to eplerenone (25 mg per day initially, titrated to a maximum of 50 mg per day; 3,319 patients) or placebo (3,313 patients) in addition to optimal medical therapy. The study continued until 1,012 deaths occurred. The primary endpoints were death from any cause, death from cardiovascular causes, hospitalization for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or ventricular arrhythmia.\nResults: During a mean follow-up of 16 months, there were 478 deaths in the eplerenone group and 554 deaths in the placebo group (relative risk, 0.85; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.75 to 0.96; p = 0.008).

A medical student reading the abstract is confused about why some participants assigned to pulmharkimab who did not adhere to the regimen were still analyzed as part of the pulmharkimab group. Which of the following best reflects the purpose of such an analysis strategy?\"\n\"Impact of pulmharkimab on asthma control and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with coronary artery disease and comorbid asthma\nIntroduction:\nActive asthma has been found to be associated with a more than two-fold increase in the risk of myocardial infarction, even after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors. It has been suggested that the inflammatory mediators and accelerated atherosclerosis characterizing systemic inflammation may increase the risk of both asthma and cardiovascular disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of the novel IL-1 inhibitor pulmharkimab in improving asthma and cardiovascular disease progression.\nMethods:\nIn this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, patients (N=1200) with a history of coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction in the past 2 years, and a diagnosis of comorbid adult-onset asthma were recruited from cardiology clinics at a large academic medical center in Philadelphia, PA. Patients who were immunocompromised or had a history of recurrent infections were excluded.\nPatients were subsequently randomly assigned a 12-month course of pulmharkimab 75 mg/day, pulmharkimab 150 mg/day, or a placebo, with each group containing 400 participants. All participants were included in analysis and analyzed in the groups to which they were randomized regardless of medication adherence. Variables measured included plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) scores, which quantified the severity of asthma symptoms. Plaque volume was determined by ultrasound.\nAnalyses were performed from baseline to month 12.\nResults:\nAt baseline, participants in the two groups did not differ by age, gender, race, plaque volume, serum LDL-C levels, FEV1/FVC ratio, and ACQ scores (p > 0.05 for all). A total of 215 participants (18%) were lost to follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, the groups contained the following numbers of participants:\nPulmharkimab 75 mg/d: 388 participants\nPulmharkimab 150 mg/d: 202 participants\nPlacebo: 395 participants\nTable 1: Association between pulmharkimab and both pulmonary and cardiovascular outcomes.

He was alert and oriented with healthy vital signs. No evidence of cognitive impairments was present on bedside testing results. The patient denied any recent infections and risk for human immunodefiency virus (HIV) infection. Neurological examination results were significant for choreiform and hemiballistic movements involving the left upper extremity. His home medications were carefully reviewed to rule out any medications that could cause chorea. A review of his previous records indicated an admission to an outside facility 3 weeks beforehand with severe hyperglycemia and a hemoglobin A1c level of 14.1% (to convert to the proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01). Despite an aggressive correction of blood glucose levels and metabolic correction, his choreiform movements had remained unresolved. On admission, a complete electrolyte and toxicology panel, including calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus, yielded normal results. The patient’s serum glucose level was 159 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555) and his hemoglobin A1c was 10.9% without ketoacidosis. Test results for antinuclear antibodies, lupus anticoagulants, and antiphospholipid antibodies were negative. Serum thyrotropin levels, liver function test results, and parathyroid hormone levels were healthy. Copper studies, a peripheral smear, and a routine electroencephalogram yielded normal results. A general screening for cancers yielded negative results. The patient underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure), which showed a T1 hyperintensity in the right caudate head and a lentiform nucleus with no restricted diffusion. Oral administration of olanzapine, 2.5 mg daily, in divided doses with careful monitoring of blood glucose levels resulted in the complete resolution of chorea.Magnetic resonance imaging shows T1 hyperintensity in the right caudate head (A) and a lentiform nucleus with no restricted diffusion (B).

Computed tomography demonstrated a 2.5-cm low-attenuation ovoid lesion at the gastroesophageal junction (Figure 1A). Considering a diagnosis of gastric tumor, she then underwent upper endoscopy that showed a mobile smooth-surfaced polypoid subepithelial lesion at the posterolateral wall of the gastroesophageal junction. The mass flopped back and forth into the gastroesophageal junction. Mucosal biopsies were performed, which were consistent with normal squamous mucosal epithelium. Following this, endoscopic ultrasonography was performed, which demonstrated an anechoic, loculated, subepithelial lesion located within the submucosa of the distal esophagus (Figure 1B). The endosonographic borders were well defined without invasion into the nearby structures. Manometry and 24-hour pH testing revealed preserved motility but abnormal acid exposure of the distal esophagus. Ultrasonography of the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas revealed no abnormalities.Diagnostic imaging for the patient. A, Contrast computed tomogram (CT) revealing a mass at the gastroesophageal junction protruding into the cardia of the stomach. B, Endoscopic ultrasonography demonstrated a cystic lesion originating and localized to the wall of the esophagus but not invading local structures. What Is Your Diagnosis?\nA.
