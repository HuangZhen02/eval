      "But x can be arbitrarily large in magnitude in the negative direction. For example, if x approaches negative infinity, -x approaches positive infinity. So, a must be less than or equal to any positive number, which implies that a must be less than or equal to 0.\n",

      "Wait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me think again.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need a to be less than or equal to -x for all x < 0. Since -x is positive for x < 0, and x can be as negative as we want, -x can be as large as we want.

      "\n",
      "I think I need to reconsider.\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually, for the inequality a <= -x to hold for all x < 0, since -x can be any positive number, a must be less than or equal to all positive numbers. The only number that is less than or equal to all positive numbers is a <= 0.\n",

In each round, both pick one card from their own set, compare the numbers, and the person with the higher number gets 1 point, and the other gets 0 points.
